        <div class="card">
            <h2>Overview of Exchange Operations</h2>
            <p>This week, we'll dive into the core operations that make up our exchange, focusing on the mechanics behind order matching and how trades are executed within our limit order book simulator.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Types of Orders</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Limit Orders:</strong> Orders to buy or sell at a specified price or better.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Orders:</strong> Orders to buy or sell immediately at the best available price.</li>
                <li><strong>Stop Orders:</strong> Orders that become executable only when a certain price level is reached.</li>
            </ul>
            We'll be focusing on limit orders for our exchange.
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Order Matching and Execution</h2>
            <p>Our exchange will use a price-time priority mechanism for order matching. This means that orders are first ranked by their price; for orders with the same price, the order that arrived first has priority.</p>
            <p>There are many approaches to this... I'm going to leave figuring out how exactly to do it as an exercise for the reader. </p>
            <p>One way or another, you'll likely want to overload the rich comparison operators in the Order object. (Google "python compare objects by attributes")</p>
        
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Repo Structure</h2>
            The repo containing this spec also will contain the project! Git clone this bad boy to get started.
            <ul>
                <li>We're gonna be using the MVC (Model, View Controller) structure for this project. In software engineering, you'll run into the problem of coupling - functions/methods that overly depended on each other to the point where any change to repo becomes a breaking change. 
                    The MVC structure is a great way to mitigate this problem for certain software applications.</li>
                <li>The model directory will contain all of our data models (Exchange & Order).</li>
                <li>The controller directory will contain all of our functions that alter our data models.</li>
                <li>The view directory is ... currently not there. But if it was, it would contain all the functions that render our application's information.</li>
                <li>You can feel free to ignore the docs folder, that just contains the html files related to the project spec.</li>
                <li>The resources directory contains JSON that you can use to test your code. Each json file should contain a "orders" array which contains more JSON objects containing information relevant to an order.
                <li>The test directory should contain all of your testing. You'll notice that it's empty - you'll be writing your own tests! It's important to know how to test your software as an engineer and how to write your software to be testable. Also it'll come up in interviews :P.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>TODOS:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Read through the repo:</strong> Get a sense for what's what.</li>
                <li><strong>Process order:</strong> Write some code to process orders, see process_order and determine how you'd like to use it.</li>
                <li><strong>Decide on efficient order organization:</strong> Decide on how you want to organize your buy and sell orders in exchange, thinking about how you might match them.</li>
                <li><strong>Implement/Test:</strong> Implement your main exchange operations: create, delete, and update order (probably in that order). And make sure to be thinking about testability and writing tests while you implement these operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Implement/Test:</strong> Implement on_request: In practice, it would be called immediately after any create, delete, or update order to check if any orders can be fulfilled.</li>
